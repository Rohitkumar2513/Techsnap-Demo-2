        While building a software application, the question arises where will
        you store your data and how? The traditional approach is a simple text
        file or CSV file which is not a good choice in today’s big data world.
        The solution is Database Management System(DBMS) which allows different
        user application programs to concurrently access the same Database.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Database Management system(DBMS) is a simpler, easier, reliable,
        faster, secure, and powerful software tool for Storing, Managing, and
        Retrieving data. There are two types of Databases: Relational and
        Non-Relational Databases. An example of a Relational Database is SQL
        Server and a Non-Relational Database is MongoDB. We will be discussing
        the key differences between MongoDB vs SQL Server in this blog.
      </p>
      <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
      <p>
        MongoDB is an open-source, cross-platform, document-oriented, and
        non-relational database system. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and
        was first released on February 11, 2009. Its stable release is MongoDB
        5.0.5 released on 6 December 2021. It is written in different
        programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, C++, C, Ruby,
        Perl.
      </p>

        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        MongoDB is a NoSQL Server in which data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON)
        documents and each document is essentially built on a key-value pair
        structure. As MongoDB easily stores schemaless data, make it appropriate
        for capturing data whose structure is not known. This document-oriented
        approach is designed to offer a richer experience with modern
        programming techniques.

      <h2>Features of MongoDB</h2>
      <img
        class="img-3"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hevo/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1644486462/hevo-learn/mongodb-architecure/mongodb-architecure.png?_i=AA"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>Main features of MongoDB which make it unique are:</p>
      <h3>High Performance</h3>
      <p>
        Data operations on MongoDB are fast and easy because of their NoSQL
        nature. Data can be quickly stored, manipulated, and retrieved without
        any compromise on data integrity.
      </p>
      <h3>Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        In the Big Data era, MongoDB data can be distributed across a cluster of
        machines quickly and equally, free of bulkiness. The scalability of
        MongoDB handles a growing amount of data capably. Sharding is a process
        in MongoDB used to horizontally scale the data across multiple servers
        when the size of data increases.
      </p>
      <h3>Availability</h3>
      <p>
        Data is highly available with MongoDB as it makes multiple copies of the
        same data and sends copies of data across different servers. In case any
        server fails, data can be retrieved from another server without delay.
      </p>
      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB can easily be combined with different Database Management
        Systems, both SQL and NoSQL types. Document-oriented structure makes
        MongoDB schema dynamically flexible and different types of data can be
        easily stored and manipulated.
      </p>
      <h2>What is SQL Server?</h2>
      <img
        class="img-4"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hevo/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1644478410/hevo-learn/sql-server_logo/sql-server_logo.jpg?_i=AA"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System(RDBMS). It is also
        known as Microsoft SQL Server or sometimes as MSSQL. SQL Server is
        developed by Microsoft and was initially releases on April 24, 1989. Its
        stable release is SQL Server 2019 released on 4 November 2019. MSSQL is
        written in programming languages like C and C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL Server is based on the relational model introduced by E. F. Codd. In
        RDBMS data is stored in tables and the relationships among the data are
        maintained between tables. In tables, data is organized in rows and
        columns format. Each column represents a particular field or feature and
        each row in the table represents an entry or a record.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft SQL Server offers a variety of editions with different
        functionally: Express, Enterprise, Standard, Web, Developer. Express
        edition is freeware for small and entry-level applications while others
        are licensed-based editions used for bigger projects on commercial
        levels based on the service required. SQL Server supports XML data type
        format and dynamic management views.

        alt=""
      />
      <p>Main features of SQL Server that make it highly usable are:</p>
      <h3>Cloud Database Support</h3>
      <p>
        Microsoft SQL Server offers editions that can be integrated with
        Microsoft cloud or Azure SQL with built-in security and manageability.
        Cloud database support makes SQL Server highly available, fast failover
        with minimum uptime.
      </p>
      <h3>Ease of Management</h3>
      <p>
        Microsoft SQL Servers can easily be used with Windows and Linux systems.
        SQL Server deployment and its management is easy with Kubernetes.
      </p>
      <h3>High Security</h3>
      <p>
        Data in SQL Server is encrypted and highly secured. Schemas and Tables
        can be password protected easily and can be accessed with permissions
        only.
      </p>
      <h3>End-to-End Business Data Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        SQL Server mainly focuses on commercial needs so it provides end-to-end
        business data solutions. Microsoft SQL Server offers tools for Data
        Administration, ETL solutions, Online Analytical Processing(OLAP), and
        Data Mining purposes. It additionally provides Option Reporting,
        Interactive Analysis, and Visual Data Exploration using SQL Server BI
        tools.

      </figure>
      <p>
        The following section talks about the primary differences between
        MongoDB vs SQL Server in detail:
      </p>
      <h3>Developed by and Initial Release</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and was initially released on
        February 11, 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL Server is developed by Microsoft Corporation and was initially
        released on April 24, 1989.
      </p>
      <h3>Database Model</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB is a Non-Relational Database based on a document-oriented
        structure that internally is based on a key-value structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL Server is a Relational Database based on relatable structured tables
        with various rows and columns.
      </p>
      <h3>Implementation Language</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB is implemented in JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, C++, C, Ruby,
        Perl, C, C++ whereas SQL Server is implemented in C and C++.
      </p>
      <h3>License</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB is an Open-Source DBMS whereas a SQL Server license is required
        for commercial purposes.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Schema</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB has a flexible dynamic schema that can easily be changed with
        the evolution of data, application, or business.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL Server has a fixed Schema that is predefined before inserting any
        data. Fixed schema means schema can’t be changed as data, application,
        or business requirement evolves.
      </p>
      <h3>Query Language</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB uses MongoDB Query Language to query unstructured data from the
        database.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL Server uses SQL Query Language to Create Tables, Insert, Fetch or
        Update data in the database.
      </p>
      <h3>Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB supports Horizontal Scaling in which data is distributed across
        clusters. The Sharding process is used to implement horizontal scaling
        which results in an always-up server.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL Server supports vertical scaling which is the traditional approach.
        In vertical scaling, physical or virtual resources are added to the
        hosting server of the database.
      </p>
      <h3>Map Reduce</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB supports a data processing algorithm for concentrating large
        volumes of data into aggregated results. MongoDB provides the MapReduce
        database command to perform map-reduce operations.
      </p>
      <p>SQL Server does not support the Map-Reduce method.</p>
      <h3>Joins</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB is a non-relational database so it does not support JOINs
        whereas SQL Server used JOINS to retrieve data from multiple tables
        which are joined.
      </p>
      <h3>Transaction</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB provides multi-document ACID transactions (ACID is an acronym
        for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) with snapshot
        isolation, which ensures that the database is in a valid state after a
        set of database operations is executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        MS SQL Server also provides ACID transactions with data integrity
        without snapshot isolation.
      </p>
      <h3>XML support</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB doesn’t support XML structured documents. Documents in MongoDB
        are stored in BSON format.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL Server provides support for XML structured data. XML support is
        integrated into all the components of SQL Server.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        MongoDB is a database that is more advanced and capable of handling big
        data with dynamic schema features. SQL Server is an RDBMS that is used
        to manage the relational database system and offers end-to-end business
        data solutions. In the case of unstructured data MongoDB is a good
        choice. Also, MongoDB is open source which makes it readily available.
      </p>
      <p>
        No doubt SQL Server is going strong for many years but now with the era
        of Big Data, MongoDB seems to have a bright future. But, that doesn’t
        mean SQL Server will be completely eradicated. The choice of database
        between MongoDB and SQL Server is completely specific to the user’s
        needs.
